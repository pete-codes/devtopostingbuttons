# devtopostingbuttons
A copy of the dev.to buttons

I post a lot on dev.to and wanted to replicate the process of posting an article. 

I made some buttons and added a jQuery script so that when a user clicks the buttons are replaced with a div that has a turqouise background and text saying it worked.
